## Requirements

This project currently supports macOS and Windows. Linux build/file-operation support has been removed for now.

### Common

- Node.js 18+
- Rust 1.77+
- npm 9+

### Platform Dependencies

#### macOS

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yunz93/markdown-press.git
cd markdown-press
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure AI (optional)

You can enter the Gemini or OpenAI API key in the app settings, or provide it locally:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

OpenAI-compatible APIs are also supported; configure the base URL and key in settings.

### 4. Run in development mode

```bash
npm run tauri:dev
```

## Build

### Web build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Desktop build

```bash
npm run tauri:build
```

Artifacts are generated under `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

### GitHub Tag Auto Build

The repository is configured with a GitHub Actions release workflow. Push a `v`-prefixed tag to automatically build and upload macOS / Windows installers.

```bash
git tag v0.1.1
git push origin v0.1.1
```

CI automatically syncs the version in `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, and `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` to the tag, then runs the Tauri build and uploads to GitHub Releases.

### macOS signing & notarization

Apps downloaded from the browser must be **Developer ID signed and notarized** to pass Gatekeeper. Otherwise macOS shows “cannot verify developer” or “damaged” warnings.

The release workflow signs and notarizes automatically when the GitHub Secrets below are configured. Without them it falls back to ad-hoc signing and users must run `xattr -cr`.

Configure these in **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

| Secret                       | Purpose                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE`          | Base64-encoded Developer ID Application `.p12` export  |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | Password used when exporting the `.p12`                |
| `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD`          | Temporary CI keychain password                         |
| `APPLE_ID`                   | Apple ID email (use with password auth below)          |
| `APPLE_PASSWORD`             | App-specific password                                  |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID`              | Apple Developer Team ID                                |
| `APPLE_API_KEY`              | App Store Connect API Key ID (recommended alternative) |
| `APPLE_API_ISSUER`           | App Store Connect Issuer ID                            |
| `APPLE_API_KEY_CONTENT`      | Full `.p8` private key text                            |

See the [Tauri macOS signing guide](https://v2.tauri.app/distribute/sign/macos/) for certificate export and notarization details.

## Release Smoke Test

The project includes a release smoke-test script:

```bash
npm run smoke:release
```

See [RELEASE_SMOKE_TEST.md](./RELEASE_SMOKE_TEST.md) for the manual checklist.

## Development Notes

- Dark mode is the default theme
- `.trash` is an internal application directory and should not be edited manually
- The preview pipeline supports wiki links, heading jumps, block references, and attachment resolution
- Mermaid diagrams prefer beautiful-mermaid (flowchart, state, sequence, class, ER, xychart-beta); pie, gantt, and other types fall back to official Mermaid
- Settings allow separate UI, editor, preview, and code font configuration
- The default font is the system font, with 仓耳今楷 available as a bundled Chinese font option
- External file change watch: if a file is modified outside the app with no unsaved edits, it reloads automatically
